Unfortunetly our run-time is ineffective and through rigourous code-checking
and troubleshooting, the outcome remained the same. When compressing,
please be patient. It can take some time. Smaller files can be compressed and
decompressed easily but the algorithm was trouble of working with
larger files like book.txt or dan.bmp.
